# PhoneNumberValidation
Verify if string is a phone number is of valid format

### Project has 2 files: valid.py and test_valid1.py
valid.py has the python code for checking if the string is of valid format, if yes, it is classified as Matching otherwise it is classified as Non-matching

test_valid1.py is used for testing the valid.py file
- it imports pytest (to use this do : pip install pytest)
- It also imports valid (import valid) which is actually my valid.py file where my python code is present
- I have used pytest to test this script. 
- I have tested the script with different test cases and got the results in each of them. 
- Also committing a test case document for this script

### To run the script and test cases use: 

### pytest -v

Attaching the screenshot of the results.
